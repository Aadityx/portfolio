  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  I’m Aaditya, a Computer Engineering undergraduate pursuing a B.Tech, 
   with a Diploma in Computer Engineering. 
   I am a full-stack-oriented
    web developer with hands-on experience in front-end development 
    and a strong interest in backend technologies.
    I enjoy building clean, responsive, and interactive web applications
     that focus on both visual appeal and user experience. 
     I’m continuously learning modern web technologies, 
     exploring prompt engineering, and expanding my skill set 
     to grow into a well-rounded full-stack engineer.
